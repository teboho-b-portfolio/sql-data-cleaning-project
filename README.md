# Portfolio Project 1: SQL Data Cleaning

This project focuses on cleaning a real-world layoffs dataset using SQL. It is my first data project and was created to practice essential data cleaning techniques before analysis.

### Dataset:
Layoffs 2022 – Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022

### Objective

- Clean and prepare raw data for analysis

- Practice SQL data cleaning workflows

### Tools

SQL (MySQL)

### Cleaning Steps

- Created staging tables to preserve raw data

- Removed duplicate records using ROW_NUMBER()

- Standardised industry, country, and date formats

- Handled null values appropriately

- Removed rows and columns with no usable layoff data

### Outcome

A clean, standardised dataset ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA).




# Portfolio Project 2: SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on exploring and analysing a cleaned layoffs dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using SQL.

### Dataset:
Layoffs 2022 – Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022

### Objective

Explore the data to identify trends and patterns

Practice analytical SQL queries using real-world data
